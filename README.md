###Introduction
This was a group project to help people who are undecided about what type of vacation they would like to take. Users would take a survey and the survey will help determine their destination based on their preferences. The group was divided into a front end and back end team, half worked on API's and connecting the site and half work on HTML, Javascript, and CSS.

###Technologies
This is fairly simple app using:

- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/)
