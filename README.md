This was a group project to help people who are undecided about what type of vacation they would like to take. Users would take a survey and the survey will help determine their destination based on their preferences. The group was divided into a front end and back end team, half worked on API's and connecting the site and half work on HTML, Javascript, and CSS.

The deployed version of the site can be found here: https://suzannaudra.github.io/Voyage/
